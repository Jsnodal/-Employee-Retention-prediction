#    Employee Retention prediction.
# Key Insights:
Satisfaction Drives Attrition: Employees with lower satisfaction levels are more likely to leave. This suggests that improving job satisfaction could significantly reduce turnover.
Project Load Correlates with Evaluation and Working Hours: Employees handling more projects tend to receive better evaluations and work more hours, indicating a higher engagement level.
Lack of Promotions Contributes to Attrition: Employees who have not received a promotion in the past 5 years are slightly more likely to leave.
Work Accidents and Attrition: While the correlation is weak, employees who have had accidents at work are marginally more likely to leave.
# Recommendations:
Focus on improving employee satisfaction by exploring workplace conditions, management practices, and employee engagement.
Ensure fair project distribution that matches employees' capabilities without overwhelming them.
Offer clearer career advancement opportunities, especially for employees with long tenure and those who have not been promoted recently.
Monitor work accidents to prevent any negative impact on employee well-being and retention.
